# Market Data Collection & Processing

## Overview

Build a comprehensive market data collection and processing system that ingests real-time and historical data from multiple brokers, normalizes it into a unified format, and provides efficient distribution to consuming services. This epic includes surge detection capabilities and high-performance time-series data storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time price streaming for 500+ symbols initially (scaling to 1,800+)
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable with automatic reconnection
- [ ] Data normalization layer handles all broker-specific formats
- [ ] Surge detection identifies momentum within 100ms
- [ ] ClickHouse stores and queries time-series data efficiently
- [ ] Redis pub/sub distributes real-time updates to consumers
- [ ] Historical data backfill capabilities implemented
- [ ] Data quality monitoring and validation in place
- [ ] Kafka topics configured for market data events
- [ ] Support for both equity and cryptocurrency markets

## Technical Approach

### Market Data Architecture
Implement a scalable data pipeline that can handle high-frequency market updates from multiple sources, perform real-time analysis, and distribute processed data to various consumers with minimal latency.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection Service**
   - Multi-broker WebSocket management
   - Connection pooling and health monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection with backfill
   - Rate-aware data requesting

2. **Data Normalization**
   - Unified data models for all market types
   - Broker-specific adapters
   - Timestamp synchronization
   - Currency conversion for crypto

3. **Surge Detection Engine**
   - Real-time price change monitoring
   - Volume spike detection
   - Momentum calculation algorithms
   - Alert generation system

4. **Time-Series Storage**
   - ClickHouse schema optimization
   - Data partitioning strategy
   - Compression configuration
   - Query performance tuning

5. **Data Distribution**
   - Kafka topic architecture
   - Redis pub/sub channels
   - WebSocket server for UI
   - gRPC streaming for services

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design Data Models**
   - Define unified market data schemas
   - Create protobuf definitions
   - Design ClickHouse tables
   - Plan Kafka topic structure

2. **Build Collection Service**
   - Implement WebSocket clients
   - Add connection management
   - Create data validation layer
   - Set up monitoring metrics

3. **Implement Normalization**
   - Create broker adapters
   - Build transformation pipeline
   - Add data enrichment
   - Implement error handling

4. **Develop Surge Detection**
   - Implement detection algorithms
   - Create alert system
   - Add configuration management
   - Build performance optimization

5. **Set Up Storage**
   - Deploy ClickHouse cluster
   - Create optimal schemas
   - Implement data retention
   - Build query interfaces

6. **Create Distribution Layer**
   - Configure Kafka producers
   - Set up Redis publishers
   - Build WebSocket server
   - Implement gRPC streaming

## Dependencies

- **1000**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires databases and messaging infrastructure
- **2000**: Multi-Broker Integration Layer - Needs broker connections for data sources

## Testing Plan

- WebSocket connection stability tests
- Data normalization accuracy validation
- Surge detection algorithm verification
- Storage performance benchmarks
- Distribution latency measurements
- Load testing with high data volumes
- Failover and recovery scenarios

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use TypeScript for all Node.js services
2. Implement WebSocket clients with exponential backoff reconnection
3. Use Protocol Buffers for efficient data serialization
4. Design ClickHouse tables with proper partitioning (by day/symbol)
5. Implement data quality checks and monitoring
6. Use Redis Streams for ordered real-time data distribution
7. Create comprehensive logging for data pipeline debugging
8. Build a data replay system for testing and recovery
9. Implement circuit breakers for external data sources
```

## Notes

- Market data is critical for all trading decisions
- Consider implementing data compression for storage efficiency
- WebSocket connections require careful management to avoid drops
- Surge detection parameters need fine-tuning based on market behavior
- Data quality issues can cascade through the entire system
