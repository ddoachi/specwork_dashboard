```

## Description
The Document Viewer epic provides comprehensive markdown rendering and file navigation capabilities for the dashboard. Users can browse the JTS specification hierarchy, view formatted markdown content with syntax highlighting, and navigate between related specifications through internal links.

## Scope
- [ ] Markdown renderer with GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- [ ] YAML frontmatter display with collapsible metadata panels
- [ ] File tree explorer mirroring JTS specs directory structure
- [ ] Internal navigation with clickable spec ID links
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for code blocks within specifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Markdown files render with proper formatting and styling
- [ ] YAML frontmatter displays in structured, readable format
- [ ] File tree accurately reflects JTS specs directory structure
- [ ] Clicking spec IDs navigates to corresponding specification
- [ ] Code blocks display with appropriate syntax highlighting

## Dependencies
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Requires access to spec file content
- E01 (Dashboard Core) - Integrates with main dashboard layout

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: Markdown Rendering Engine
- F02: Frontmatter Display Component
- F03: File Tree Explorer
- F04: Internal Link Navigation
- F05: Code Syntax Highlighting

## Technical Considerations
- Use react-markdown with remark/rehype plugins
- Implement custom renderers for spec ID links
- Use monaco-editor or prism for syntax highlighting
- Consider virtualization for large file trees
- Cache rendered markdown for performance

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Essential for spec content consumption
- Focus on readability and navigation efficiency
