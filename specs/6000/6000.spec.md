# Order Execution & Portfolio Management

## Overview

Build a sophisticated order execution and portfolio management system that handles intelligent order routing, execution optimization, and real-time portfolio tracking. This epic includes smart order routing across multiple brokers, slippage minimization, execution quality analysis, and comprehensive portfolio state management with real-time P&L tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Smart order routing with broker selection optimization
- [ ] Multiple order types support (market, limit, stop, bracket)
- [ ] Real-time order lifecycle management and tracking
- [ ] Execution quality monitoring and slippage analysis
- [ ] Multi-broker position aggregation and reconciliation
- [ ] Real-time P&L calculation and portfolio valuation
- [ ] Order retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Trade confirmation and settlement tracking
- [ ] Portfolio rebalancing algorithms
- [ ] Commission and fee calculation across all brokers

## Technical Approach

### Order Execution Architecture
Implement a centralized order management system that coordinates execution across multiple brokers while maintaining real-time visibility into order status, execution quality, and portfolio state.

### Key Components

1. **Smart Order Router**
   - Multi-criteria broker selection
   - Execution cost analysis
   - Rate limit optimization
   - Failover routing logic
   - Order splitting for large sizes

2. **Order Management System**
   - Order lifecycle tracking
   - State machine implementation
   - Retry and error handling
   - Execution confirmation
   - Settlement monitoring

3. **Portfolio Manager**
   - Real-time position tracking
   - Multi-broker reconciliation
   - P&L calculation engine
   - Cash balance management
   - Corporate action handling

4. **Execution Analytics**
   - Slippage measurement
   - Fill rate analysis
   - Execution speed metrics
   - Broker performance comparison
   - Cost analysis reporting

5. **Risk Integration**
   - Pre-trade risk validation
   - Position limit enforcement
   - Real-time exposure monitoring
   - Emergency liquidation
   - Compliance checking

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design Order System**
   - Define order data models
   - Create state machine logic
   - Design broker abstraction
   - Plan error handling

2. **Build Order Router**
   - Implement routing algorithms
   - Create broker selection logic
   - Add cost optimization
   - Build failover mechanisms

3. **Implement Order Manager**
   - Create order tracking system
   - Build state management
   - Add retry logic
   - Implement confirmation handling

4. **Develop Portfolio Manager**
   - Build position tracking
   - Implement P&L calculation
   - Add reconciliation logic
   - Create balance management

5. **Create Execution Analytics**
   - Build metrics collection
   - Implement performance analysis
   - Add reporting capabilities
   - Create quality scoring

6. **Integrate Risk Controls**
   - Add pre-trade validation
   - Implement limit checking
   - Create emergency controls
   - Build compliance framework

## Dependencies

- **1000**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires messaging and database infrastructure
- **2000**: Multi-Broker Integration Layer - Needs broker connections for order execution
- **3000**: Market Data Collection & Processing - Requires real-time pricing for order decisions
- **4000**: Trading Strategy Engine & DSL - Needs strategy signals to generate orders
- **5000**: Risk Management System - Requires position sizing and risk validation

## Testing Plan

- Order routing algorithm validation tests
- Order state machine transition tests
- Multi-broker execution simulation tests
- Portfolio reconciliation accuracy tests
- P&L calculation validation tests
- Execution quality measurement tests
- Emergency liquidation scenario tests

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use TypeScript with strict typing for all order and portfolio models
2. Implement order state machine with comprehensive logging
3. Store all orders and fills in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
4. Use Redis for real-time order status caching
5. Implement idempotent order operations to prevent duplicates
6. Create comprehensive error handling for broker API failures
7. Use event-driven architecture for order status updates
8. Implement proper transaction isolation for portfolio updates
9. Create detailed audit trails for all order operations
10. Use WebSocket connections for real-time order status updates
```

## Notes

- Order execution is mission-critical and must be highly reliable
- Portfolio accuracy is essential for risk management decisions
- Consider implementing partial fill handling for large orders
- Order routing algorithms should learn from execution quality data
- All order operations must be auditable and reversible
