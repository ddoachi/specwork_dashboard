# Storage Performance Optimization

## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimizations across all storage tiers to maximize I/O performance for the JTS trading system. This includes SSD-specific optimizations (I/O schedulers, TRIM support), filesystem tuning, and automated performance maintenance to ensure sustained high-performance operation under trading workloads.

These optimizations are critical for maintaining the sub-millisecond response times required for algorithmic trading operations and ensuring long-term storage performance stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **I/O Scheduler Optimization**: NVMe drives configured with 'none' scheduler for minimal CPU overhead
- [ ] **TRIM Support Configuration**: Automated weekly TRIM operations for all NVMe filesystems
- [ ] **SSD Longevity Optimization**: Udev rules for automatic SSD-specific optimizations
- [ ] **Systemd Timer Setup**: Automated maintenance timers for storage optimization
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Baseline performance tests for sequential and random I/O across all storage tiers
- [ ] **Optimization Scripts**: Automated scripts for ongoing performance tuning and maintenance
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance monitoring and alerting for storage bottlenecks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete performance tuning guide and troubleshooting procedures

## Technical Approach

### Performance Optimization Strategy

Implement tier-specific optimizations to maximize performance across the entire storage infrastructure:

- **Hot Storage (NVMe)**: Maximum IOPS with minimal latency for real-time operations
- **Warm Storage (SATA)**: Optimized sequential I/O for backup and log operations  
- **Cold Storage (NAS)**: Network-optimized bulk transfer performance
- **Cross-Tier**: Coordinated optimizations that don't conflict between storage types

### Key Components

1. **SSD-Specific Optimizations**
   - I/O scheduler configuration for NVMe drives
   - TRIM/discard support for SSD longevity
   - Udev rules for automatic optimization application
   - Performance monitoring and alerting

2. **Filesystem Performance Tuning**
   - Database-specific mount options already configured in Feature 1011
   - Additional runtime tuning for sustained performance
   - Performance monitoring and adjustment procedures

3. **Automated Maintenance**
   - Weekly TRIM operations for all NVMe filesystems
   - Performance benchmark automation
   - Storage health monitoring integration

### Implementation Steps

1. **SSD I/O Scheduler Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Configure NVMe I/O scheduler for optimal performance
   echo 'ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="nvme0n1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="none"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/60-ssd-scheduler.rules
   
   # Apply immediately without reboot
   echo none > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler
   
   # Verify scheduler configuration
   cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler
   ```

2. **TRIM Support Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Configure automatic TRIM support
   echo 'ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="nvme0n1", ATTR{queue/discard_max_bytes}!="0", RUN+="/sbin/fstrim -v /"' >> /etc/udev/rules.d/60-ssd-scheduler.rules
   
   # Create TRIM service for all NVMe mounts
   cat > /etc/systemd/system/fstrim-all.service << 'EOF'

       local tier_name=$2
       
       echo "Testing $tier_name sequential I/O on $mount_point"
       
       # Sequential write test
       echo "  Sequential Write:"
       dd if=/dev/zero of="$mount_point/seq_write_test" bs=1M count=1000 oflag=direct 2>&1 | tail -1

       echo "  Sequential Read:"
       dd if="$mount_point/seq_write_test" of=/dev/null bs=1M 2>&1 | tail -1
       
       # Cleanup
       rm -f "$mount_point/seq_write_test"
   }
   
   test_random_iops() {
       local mount_point=$1
       local tier_name=$2
       
       echo "Testing $tier_name random IOPS on $mount_point"
       
       # Random read IOPS test (requires fio)
       if command -v fio >/dev/null 2>&1; then

               --filename="$mount_point/random_test" | grep -E "(read|IOPS)"
           rm -f "$mount_point/random_test"
       else
           echo "  fio not installed - skipping random IOPS test"
       fi
   }
   
   # Test hot storage performance
   echo "🔥 Hot Storage (NVMe) Performance Tests:"
   for mount in /var/lib/postgresql /var/lib/clickhouse /var/lib/kafka; do

   #!/bin/bash
   
   echo "⚙️ SSD Optimization Status Check"
   echo "==============================="
   
   # Check I/O scheduler
   echo "📊 I/O Scheduler Status:"
   echo "NVMe0n1: $(cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler 2>/dev/null || echo 'Not found')"
   
   # Check TRIM support
