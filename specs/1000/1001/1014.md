# Cold Storage (NAS) Integration

## Overview

Configure the high-capacity cold storage tier using a 28TB Synology NAS for historical market data, long-term backups, and archival storage. This tier provides massive storage capacity for data that requires infrequent access but must be retained for compliance, analysis, and historical backtesting purposes.

The NAS integration includes network optimization, organized directory structure, and automated archival processes to efficiently manage the vast amounts of historical trading data generated by the JTS system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **NFS Mount Optimization**: Enhanced NFS mount configuration with 1MB read/write buffers for bulk operations
- [x] **Directory Structure**: Comprehensive organized directory structure for different data types (archives, market-data, backtesting, models, development)
- [x] **Network Optimization**: Optimized network buffer settings for improved NFS performance
- [x] **Permission Configuration**: Proper ownership and permissions for NAS directory structure
- [x] **Connectivity Validation**: Reliable NFS connectivity with timeout and retry configuration
- [x] **Performance Testing**: Network throughput benchmarking for large file operations
- [x] **Integration Points**: Ready integration points for archival scripts and automated processes
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: NAS connectivity and space monitoring capabilities

## Technical Approach

### NAS Integration Architecture

Design efficient network storage integration optimized for:
- **Bulk Data Operations**: Large file transfers with optimized network buffers
- **Archive Storage**: Long-term retention of historical market data and backups
- **Development Resources**: Shared storage for notebooks, datasets, and experimental data
- **Compliance Storage**: Secure long-term storage for regulatory compliance

### Key Components

1. **Network Storage Configuration**
   - 28TB Synology NAS at 192.168.1.101
   - NFSv3 with TCP for reliable large file operations
   - Optimized read/write buffer sizes (1MB) for bulk transfers
   - Enhanced timeout and retry settings for reliability

2. **Directory Organization**

   ```

3. **Network Performance Optimization**
   - Increased kernel network buffers for NFS operations
   - Optimized NFS mount parameters for bulk data transfers
   - Connection reliability with appropriate timeout settings

### Implementation Steps

1. **Current NFS Mount Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check current NFS mount status
   mount | grep synology
   df -h /mnt/synology
   
   # Test current connectivity
   ping -c 5 192.168.1.101
   
   # Check current NFS performance
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/synology/speed_test bs=1M count=100 2>&1 | tail -1
   rm /mnt/synology/speed_test
   ```

2. **Network Buffer Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Backup current sysctl configuration
   cp /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.conf.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   
   # Add NFS performance optimizations
   cat >> /etc/sysctl.conf << 'EOF'
   
   # JTS NAS - Network buffer optimizations for NFS
   net.core.rmem_default = 262144
   net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
   net.core.wmem_default = 262144
   net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
   EOF
   
   # Apply network optimizations
   sysctl -p
   ```

3. **Enhanced NFS Mount Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Unmount current NFS mount
   sudo umount /mnt/synology
   
   # Backup current fstab
   cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   
   # Update fstab with optimized NFS mount
   sed -i '/192.168.1.101:\/volume1\/cocodev/d' /etc/fstab
   
   cat >> /etc/fstab << 'EOF'
   
   # JTS NAS - Optimized NFS mount for bulk data operations
   192.168.1.101:/volume1/cocodev /mnt/synology nfs rw,hard,intr,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,timeo=600,retrans=2,_netdev 0 0
   EOF
   
   # Remount with optimized settings
   sudo mount /mnt/synology
   
   # Verify optimized mount
   mount | grep synology
   ```

4. **NAS Directory Structure Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create comprehensive directory structure
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/{archives,market-data,backtesting,models,development}
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/archives/{database,configs,strategies}
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/market-data/{raw,processed,indicators}
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/backtesting/{datasets,results,reports}
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/models/{training,models,validation}
   mkdir -p /mnt/synology/jts/development/{datasets,notebooks,experiments}
   
   # Set proper ownership
   chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/synology/jts/
   
   # Set appropriate permissions
   chmod -R 755 /mnt/synology/jts/
   ```

5. **Performance Testing and Validation**
   ```bash
   # Test large file write performance
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/synology/jts/development/write_test bs=1M count=1000 2>&1
   
   # Test large file read performance  
   dd if=/mnt/synology/jts/development/write_test of=/dev/null bs=1M 2>&1
   
   # Test concurrent access
   for i in {1..3}; do
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/synology/jts/development/concurrent_test_$i bs=1M count=100 &
   done
   wait
   
   # Cleanup test files
   rm /mnt/synology/jts/development/{write_test,concurrent_test_*}
   ```

6. **Health Monitoring Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create NAS health check script
   cat > scripts/nas-health-check.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   
   echo "🧊 JTS Cold Storage (NAS) Health Check - $(date)"
   echo "============================================="
   
   # Check NAS connectivity
   echo "📡 NAS Connectivity:"
   ping -c 2 192.168.1.101 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✅ NAS reachable" || echo "❌ NAS unreachable"
   
   # Check mount status
   echo -e "\n💾 Mount Status:"
   mount | grep synology || echo "❌ NAS not mounted"
   
   # Check space usage
   echo -e "\n📊 Storage Usage:"
   df -h /mnt/synology | tail -1
   
   # Check directory structure
   echo -e "\n📁 Directory Structure:"
   ls -la /mnt/synology/jts/ 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ JTS directory not found"
   
   # Network performance test
   echo -e "\n⚡ Network Performance Test:"
   timeout 10s dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/synology/jts/development/speed_test bs=1M count=50 2>&1 | tail -1
   rm -f /mnt/synology/jts/development/speed_test
   EOF
   
   chmod +x scripts/nas-health-check.sh
   ```

- **Integration Testing**: Ensure integration points work for future archival scripts

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing NAS integration:

NETWORK OPTIMIZATION:
1. NFS performance depends heavily on buffer sizes - use 1MB buffers
2. Configure appropriate timeout values for reliable operations
3. Use hard mounts with proper retry settings for data integrity
4. Test network performance before and after optimization

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION:
1. Create logical separation for different data types
2. Allocate appropriate space estimates for each category
3. Plan for future expansion of data categories
4. Maintain consistent permission structure

NFS BEST PRACTICES:
1. Use NFSv3 with TCP for large file reliability
2. Configure client-side caching appropriately
3. Monitor network utilization during bulk operations
4. Implement proper error handling for network issues

PARALLEL EXECUTION:
1. This feature is completely independent of hot storage setup
2. Can run simultaneously with SATA warm storage setup
3. Provides immediate benefit for development data management
4. No impact on critical trading system performance

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Network latency is higher than local storage - optimize for bulk operations
2. Batch small operations to minimize network round-trips
3. Use compression for large data transfers when appropriate
4. Monitor bandwidth utilization during market hours
```
