# Context: Warm Storage (SATA) Setup

**Spec**: [Task 1013 - Warm Storage SATA](1013.md)  
**Parent**: [Feature 1001 - Storage Infrastructure](spec.md)  
**Status**: completed  
**Created**: 2025-08-25  
**Updated**: 2025-08-26

## Summary
Successfully completed Warm Storage (SATA) setup with automated scripts, health monitoring, and comprehensive documentation. Configured 1TB SATA drive with btrfs and zstd:3 compression for optimal space efficiency.

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-25 - Complete Implementation
**Duration**: 2.5 hours  
**Participants**: User, Claude  
**Status**: completed

#### Implementation
- Created automated setup script for SATA configuration
- Implemented btrfs with zstd:3 compression
- Developed health monitoring system
- Wrote comprehensive documentation

#### Deliverables Created
- [SATA Setup Script](deliverables/scripts/setup-sata-storage.sh) - 262 lines
- [Health Monitor](deliverables/scripts/sata-health-check.sh) - 397 lines  
- [Setup Documentation](deliverables/docs/WARM_STORAGE_SETUP.md) - 383 lines

#### Testing
- Verified btrfs configuration
- Tested compression ratios
- Validated monitoring alerts

## Deliverables

### Scripts
- [SATA Setup Script](deliverables/scripts/setup-sata-storage.sh) - Automated warm storage configuration
- [Health Check Script](deliverables/scripts/sata-health-check.sh) - Monitor SATA health and performance

### Documentation  
- [Warm Storage Setup Guide](deliverables/docs/WARM_STORAGE_SETUP.md) - Complete setup and maintenance guide

### Integration Points
- Storage Manager Service: Will use warm storage for recent data
- Data Pipeline: Archives to warm storage after 7 days
- Monitoring System: Integrates with health check alerts

## Metrics

### Implementation
- **Total Sessions**: 1
- **Total Duration**: 2.5 hours
- **Lines of Code**: 1,042
- **Files Created**: 3

### Quality
- **Storage Capacity**: 931.5 GB available
- **Compression Ratio**: zstd:3 (typically 2-3x)
- **Performance**: Optimized for bulk operations
- **Acceptance Criteria Met**: 8/8 ‚úÖ

## Notes & Learnings

### Technical Decisions
- Chose btrfs over ext4 for compression support
- Used zstd:3 for balanced speed/compression
- Implemented automated cleanup for old data

### Key Achievements
- üóÑÔ∏è 1TB warm storage tier operational
- üóúÔ∏è Compression saves 50-66% space
- üîß Fully automated setup process
- üìä Comprehensive health monitoring
- üìö Complete documentation package

## Architecture Discussion (2025-08-28)

### Questions Reviewed from Spec 1003 (Monorepo Structure)

**Q1: Why do `brokers` and `domain` exist in `libs/`?**

**Answer**: This is correct according to Nx monorepo architecture with DDD:
- `libs/brokers/`: Contains broker integration libraries (Creon, KIS, Binance, Upbit) as shared libraries that can be imported by multiple services
- `libs/domain/`: Contains business domain logic following DDD principles - centralized and reusable across services

This separation follows the dependency rule: apps can depend on libs, but not vice versa.

**Q2: Market Data Collector and Notification Service placement inconsistency**

**Issue Identified**: In the System Architecture Layers diagram, these services are shown in the Integration Layer, but in the Workspace Structure, they're in `apps/`.

**Resolution**: 
- These should be standalone microservices in `apps/` (current workspace structure is correct)
- The architecture diagram should be updated to show them in the Business Layer
- They use integration libraries from `libs/brokers/` but are themselves business services

**Q3: No `src/` directory at project root**

**Answer**: This is standard for Nx monorepo structure:
- Each app and lib has its own `src/` directory internally
- Root level contains only workspace-wide configuration
- Documentation folders (`specs/`, `context/`) can optionally be moved to `docs/` for better organization

### Action Items
- ‚úÖ Document architecture clarifications
- ‚è≥ Update spec 1003 to fix architecture layer diagram
