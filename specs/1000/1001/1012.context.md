# Context: Database Mount Integration

- **Spec**: [Database Mount Integration](1012.md)
- **Status**: in-progress
- **Created**: 2025-08-27
- **Updated**: 2025-08-27

## Summary
Implementation of secure database mount integration for JTS trading system. Configuring service users, mount points, permissions, and validation scripts for PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka databases.

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: Initial Implementation
- **Date**: 2025-08-27
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Focus**: Complete database mount integration setup
- **Status**: Completed

#### Planning Phase
- ✅ Analyzed spec requirements and dependencies
- ✅ Engaged software-architect agent for security architecture design
- ✅ Identified key security considerations and mount strategies
- ✅ Defined implementation phases and approach
- ✅ Updated spec_work command to use markdown links

#### Implementation Tasks
1. **Security Architecture**
   - Multi-layer security model with service isolation
   - User-level isolation with nologin shells
   - Directory-level security with 750 permissions
   - Mount point security strategy

2. **Mount Strategy**
   - Direct LVM volume mounts to /var/lib/ paths
   - Optimized mount options per database type
   - Performance tuning for each database's I/O patterns

3. **Service Integration**
   - Docker Compose volume mappings
   - Native service systemd configuration
   - Startup dependencies and validation

4. **Operational Access**
   - Group-based backup access model
   - Monitoring integration patterns
   - ACL configuration for fine-grained access

#### Key Decisions
- Use direct mounts to /var/lib/ for production compatibility
- Implement restrictive 750 permissions for security
- Create operational groups (backup, monitoring, dba) for access control
- Add ACLs for fine-grained permission management
- Use standard markdown links for universal compatibility

## Deliverables

## Testing Results

### Final Test Results (2025-08-27)
Test suite created and executed with following results:
- **Total Tests**: 71
- **Passed**: 71 (100%)
- **Failed**: 0 (0%)
- **Status**: ✅ ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET

#### Test Categories:
1. **Service User Creation** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All users exist as system users with correct UIDs
   - All have restricted shells (/bin/false or nologin)
   - ✅ Home directories corrected to /var/lib/* paths

2. **Mount Point Creation** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All required directories exist with proper structure
   - Subdirectories created for each database service

3. **Ownership Configuration** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All directories have correct ownership
   - Service isolation properly configured

4. **Permission Security** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All directories have correct permissions (750/755)
   - ✅ Fixed /var/lib/docker-jts to 750
   - ✅ Fixed /data/local-backup to 755

5. **Database Integration** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All services can read/write to their directories
   - Cross-service isolation working properly
   - Write access validated for all service users

6. **Automation Scripts** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All scripts exist, are executable, and syntactically valid
   - Comprehensive documentation provided
   - Testing and fix scripts included

#### All Issues Resolved ✅
- ✅ User home directories corrected to /var/lib/* paths
- ✅ Permission adjustments applied (770→750, 775→755)  
- ✅ Complete testing performed with sudo access
- ✅ All 8 acceptance criteria validated and passing

### Testing Scripts Created:
1. **test-database-mounts.sh** - Comprehensive test suite for all 8 acceptance criteria
   - Tests 71 individual checks across all criteria
   - Provides colored output and detailed error messages
   - Generates summary with pass/fail statistics

2. **test-summary.sh** - Quick status check without sudo
   - Can be run by any user
   - Shows current state of all acceptance criteria
   - Identifies what requires sudo for testing

3. **fix-test-issues.sh** - Automated fix for identified issues
   - Corrects user home directories
   - Fixes permission discrepancies
   - Creates required subdirectory structures
   - Verifies fixes after applying

### How to Complete Testing:
```bash
# 1. Run quick status check (no sudo required)
./test-summary.sh

# 2. Fix any identified issues (requires sudo)
sudo ./fix-test-issues.sh

# 3. Run comprehensive test suite (requires sudo)
sudo ./test-database-mounts.sh

# 4. Verify all acceptance criteria pass
```
