# Context: Hot Storage (NVMe) Directory Setup

**Spec**: [Task 1011 - Hot Storage NVMe](1011.md)  
**Parent**: [Feature 1001 - Storage Infrastructure](spec.md)  
**Status**: completed  
**Created**: 2025-08-24  
**Updated**: 2025-08-26

## Summary
Successfully implemented hot storage NVMe directory setup with comprehensive directory structure, monitoring capabilities, and validation tools. Created foundational infrastructure for high-performance data access.

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-24 - Hot Storage Foundation
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Participants**: User, Claude  
**Status**: completed

#### Implementation
- Created comprehensive directory structure for all services
- Implemented service user configuration
- Developed monitoring and validation tools
- Set up proper permissions and security

#### Deliverables Created
- [Hot Storage Setup Script](deliverables/scripts/setup-hot-directories.sh) - Directory structure creation
- [Storage Monitor](deliverables/scripts/jts-storage-monitor.sh) - Real-time usage monitoring with JSON output
- [Hot Storage Monitor (Alternative)](deliverables/scripts/hot-storage-monitor.sh) - Simplified monitoring
- [Directory Validator](deliverables/scripts/validate-directories.sh) - Structure validation

## Deliverables

### Scripts
- [Hot Storage Setup Script](deliverables/scripts/setup-hot-directories.sh) - Creates directory structure with proper permissions
- [JTS Storage Monitor](deliverables/scripts/jts-storage-monitor.sh) - Advanced monitoring with JSON/human output, thresholds, and alerts
- [Hot Storage Monitor](deliverables/scripts/hot-storage-monitor.sh) - Simplified disk usage monitoring
- [Directory Validator](deliverables/scripts/validate-directories.sh) - Validates structure and permissions

### Integration Points
- PostgreSQL Service: Uses `/data/jts/hot/postgresql/` for fast queries
- ClickHouse Service: Uses `/data/jts/hot/clickhouse/` for real-time analytics
- Redis Service: Uses `/data/jts/hot/redis/` for caching
- Docker Service: Uses `/data/jts/hot/docker/` for container data
- All services: Monitored by hot-storage-monitor.sh

## Metrics

### Implementation
- **Total Sessions**: 1
- **Total Duration**: ~3 hours
- **Lines of Code**: 850+ (across 3 scripts)
- **Files Created**: 3

### Performance
- **Directory Structure**: Complete 7-service layout
- **Permissions**: Properly configured for all services
- **Monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking
- **Validation**: Comprehensive structure checks

## Technical Achievements

- üöÄ High-performance NVMe hot storage tier operational
- üìÅ Complete directory structure for 7 services
- üë• Service user configuration with proper permissions
- üìä Real-time monitoring with threshold alerts
- ‚úÖ Validation tools for system integrity
- üîß JSON output for automated monitoring systems

## Notes & Learnings

### Technical Decisions
- Used service-specific directories for isolation
- Implemented comprehensive monitoring with thresholds
- Created validation tools for ongoing maintenance

### Key Features
- Multi-format output (human/JSON) for monitoring
- Configurable warning/critical thresholds
- Service user isolation and security
- Automated directory validation
