# Context: Development Environment Setup (1002)

**Spec**: [1002.md](1002.md)  
**Status**: planning
**Created**: 2025-08-28
**Updated**: 2025-08-28

## Pre-Implementation Discussions

### 2025-08-27 - Platform Focus Refinement
- **Decision**: Removed Mac and WebStorm setup instructions from spec
- **Rationale**: JTS is primarily a Linux/Docker-based system for production deployment
- **Impact**: Simplified spec to focus on Docker-based development environment only
- **Participants**: User request based on architecture review

### Key Points Discussed:
1. Mac development can still work through Docker Desktop but isn't a primary target
2. WebStorm users can adapt VS Code configuration as needed
3. Focus on containerized development ensures consistency across team
4. Reduces documentation maintenance burden

## Spec Revisions

### 2025-08-27 - Scope Reduction
- **Change**: Removed sections for Mac-specific setup and WebStorm IDE configuration
- **Before**: Multi-platform setup with IDE-specific configurations
- **After**: Streamlined Docker-focused development environment
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cleaner documentation
  - Single source of truth
  - Better alignment with production environment

## Implementation Planning

### Approach
- Docker-first development environment
- VS Code as recommended IDE with consistent extensions
- Standardized tooling across all developers
- Focus on Linux/WSL2 for non-Linux users

### Deliverables Planned
1. Docker Compose configuration for full dev stack
2. VS Code settings and recommended extensions
3. Environment setup script (Linux/WSL2)
4. Developer onboarding guide

## Notes
- This context file created retroactively to capture pre-implementation discussions
- Ensures important architectural decisions aren't lost
- Will be updated during actual implementation phase
