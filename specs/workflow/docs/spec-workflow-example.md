# Spec Workflow Example: Cold Storage Implementation

This example demonstrates how the new `/spec_work` command would handle the implementation of spec 1014 (Cold Storage NAS).

## Initial Command Execution

```bash
/spec_work 1014
```

### Step 1: System Finds/Creates Context File

**Path**: `specs/1000/1001/1014.context.md`

The system checks if context exists. If not, creates:

```markdown
# Context: Cold Storage (NAS) Integration

**Spec**: [[1014.spec|1014 - Cold Storage NAS]]  
**Parent**: [[spec|1001 - Storage Infrastructure]]  
**Status**: planning  
**Created**: 2025-08-26 14:30  
**Updated**: 2025-08-26 14:30

## Summary
Implementing NAS integration for 28TB cold storage tier with optimized NFS configuration.

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-26 - Initial Planning
**Duration**: In progress  
**Participants**: User, Claude  
**Status**: active

#### Planning
- Reviewing spec requirements
- Analyzing current NAS setup
- Planning implementation approach
```

### Step 2: Interactive Planning Phase

```
Claude: I've loaded spec 1014 (Cold Storage NAS Integration). 
Current status: Not started

Would you like to:
1. Review the spec requirements
2. Create implementation plan
3. Start implementation
4. Skip to implementation (I'll plan as we go)

User: 2

Claude: Creating implementation plan...

## Planned Tasks:
1. ✅ Analyze current NFS mount configuration
2. ⏳ Optimize network buffers via sysctl
3. ⏳ Configure enhanced NFS mount options
4. ⏳ Create directory structure for data organization
5. ⏳ Benchmark performance
6. ⏳ Create health monitoring script
7. ⏳ Document setup process

Shall I proceed with this plan? (yes/no/modify)

User: yes
```

### Step 3: Implementation Begins

The context file is updated with each action:

```markdown
#### Implementation
- Analyzing current NFS mount at 192.168.1.101:/storage
  - Current mount uses default options
  - Network buffers not optimized
  - No structured directories exist

- Created [[deliverables/scripts/optimize-network.sh|Network Optimization Script]]
  ```bash
  # Saved to: specs/1000/1001/deliverables/scripts/optimize-network.sh
  # Applies sysctl optimizations for NFS
  ```

- Modified system configuration
  - Updated `/etc/sysctl.conf` with buffer settings
  - Added optimized mount to `/etc/fstab`
  - Changes applied successfully

#### Commits
- `a1b2c3d`: Add network optimization script for NAS
- `d4e5f6g`: Configure enhanced NFS mount options
```

### Step 4: Creating Deliverables

When creating a deliverable:

```bash
Claude: Creating health monitoring script...

# File saved to: specs/1000/1001/deliverables/scripts/nas-health-check.sh
```

The script includes a traceback header:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generated from: specs/1000/1001/1014.spec.md
# Context: specs/1000/1001/1014.context.md
# Purpose: Monitor NAS connectivity and performance
# Created: 2025-08-26 by Claude + User
```

### Step 5: Updating Spec with Deliverables

The original spec file gets updated with deliverable links:

```markdown
## Deliverables

### Scripts
- [[deliverables/scripts/optimize-network.sh|Network Optimization]]
- [[deliverables/scripts/nas-health-check.sh|Health Monitoring]]
- [[deliverables/scripts/directory-setup.sh|Directory Structure Creation]]

### Documentation
- [[deliverables/docs/nas-setup-guide.md|Setup Guide]]
- [[deliverables/docs/troubleshooting.md|Troubleshooting Guide]]

### Configuration
- [[deliverables/config/fstab.nas|NFS Mount Configuration]]
- [[deliverables/config/sysctl.nas.conf|Network Optimization Settings]]
```

## Resuming Work Later

```bash
/spec_work 1014 --resume
```

The system loads existing context and shows:

```
Claude: Resuming work on spec 1014 (Cold Storage NAS Integration)

## Previous Session Summary:
- Session 1 (2025-08-26): Completed network optimization and NFS setup
- Status: 3/7 tasks completed
- Last activity: Created health monitoring script

## Remaining Tasks:
4. ⏳ Create directory structure for data organization
5. ⏳ Benchmark performance
6. ⏳ Document setup process
7. ⏳ Final validation

Continue from task 4? (yes/no/select)
```

## Viewing Status

```bash
/spec_work 1014 --status
```

Output:
```
# Spec 1014: Cold Storage NAS Integration

## Progress: 71% Complete (5/7 tasks)

### Completed:
✅ Network buffer optimization
✅ NFS mount configuration
✅ Directory structure creation
✅ Health monitoring script
✅ Performance benchmarking

### In Progress:
⏳ Documentation (50% complete)

### Blocked:
❌ None

### Deliverables Created:

### Last Commit: b2c3d4e - "Add performance benchmarking results"
```

## Deliverables Report

```bash
/spec_work 1014 --deliverables
```

Generates a comprehensive report:

```markdown

```

## Benefits Over Current System

### Before (Current Problems)
- ❌ Context file doesn't list actual files modified
- ❌ Deliverables scattered without clear origin
- ❌ No bidirectional links between artifacts
- ❌ Lost implementation scripts
- ❌ Can't trace from deliverable back to spec

### After (New System)
- ✅ Every file change logged in context timeline
- ✅ Deliverables co-located with specs
- ✅ All artifacts interconnected with Obsidian links
- ✅ Complete implementation history preserved
- ✅ Full bidirectional traceability

## Mobile Workflow

On mobile (via Obsidian):

1. Open any spec file
2. Tap [[context]] link → See implementation history
3. Tap any [[deliverable]] → View actual script/doc
4. From deliverable, tap [[spec]] → Return to spec
5. Navigate parent/child specs via [[../spec]] links

All links work seamlessly, making it easy to:
- Review implementation progress on the go
- Prepare for next session
- Understand dependencies
- Check deliverable status
