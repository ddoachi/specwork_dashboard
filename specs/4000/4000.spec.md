# Trading Strategy Engine & DSL

## Overview

Build a comprehensive trading strategy engine that executes algorithmic trading decisions based on a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL). This epic includes the development of a complete technical analysis library, strategy interpreter, and execution framework that enables sophisticated automated trading strategies with real-time signal generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom DSL parser and interpreter for strategy definition
- [ ] Complete technical indicators library (20+ indicators)
- [ ] Real-time strategy execution engine with sub-second latency
- [ ] Strategy versioning and A/B testing framework
- [ ] Performance analytics and strategy comparison tools
- [ ] Dynamic parameter optimization capabilities
- [ ] Multi-timeframe analysis support
- [ ] Pattern recognition system for chart patterns
- [ ] Strategy template library with proven strategies
- [ ] Risk-aware position sizing algorithms

## Technical Approach

### Strategy Engine Architecture
Implement a high-performance strategy execution engine that can process real-time market data, evaluate complex trading conditions, and generate actionable signals with minimal latency.

### Key Components

1. **DSL Parser & Interpreter**
   - Custom grammar for trading logic
   - TypeScript-based AST generation
   - Runtime evaluation engine
   - Variable binding and scoping
   - Function composition support

2. **Technical Indicators Library**
   - Moving averages (SMA, EMA, WMA, TEMA)
   - Oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Williams %R)
   - Volatility indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR, VIX)
   - Volume analysis (OBV, VWAP, Chaikin MFI)
   - Trend indicators (ADX, Parabolic SAR, Ichimoku)

3. **Strategy Execution Engine**
   - Real-time data processing pipeline
   - Multi-symbol strategy coordination
   - Event-driven signal generation
   - Strategy state management
   - Performance tracking

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Chart pattern detection algorithms
   - Candlestick pattern recognition
   - Support/resistance level identification
   - Trend line detection
   - Breakout pattern analysis

5. **Strategy Management**
   - Strategy lifecycle management
   - Version control and rollback
   - A/B testing framework
   - Performance comparison tools
   - Parameter optimization engine

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design DSL Specification**
   - Define grammar and syntax rules
   - Create language documentation
   - Design built-in functions
   - Establish variable scoping rules

2. **Build DSL Parser**
   - Implement tokenizer and lexer
   - Create abstract syntax tree
   - Build expression evaluator
   - Add error handling and validation

3. **Develop Indicators Library**
   - Implement core mathematical functions
   - Create indicator calculation engine
   - Add multi-timeframe support
   - Optimize for real-time performance

4. **Create Strategy Engine**
   - Build real-time execution framework
   - Implement signal generation logic
   - Add strategy state management
   - Create performance tracking

5. **Implement Pattern Recognition**
   - Develop pattern detection algorithms
   - Create chart analysis tools
   - Add pattern-based signals
   - Build pattern library

6. **Build Management System**
   - Create strategy registry
   - Implement version control
   - Add A/B testing framework
   - Build optimization tools

## Dependencies

- **1000**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires monorepo structure and messaging infrastructure
- **2000**: Multi-Broker Integration Layer - Needs broker connections for order execution
- **3000**: Market Data Collection & Processing - Requires real-time market data for strategy evaluation

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for all technical indicators
- DSL parser and interpreter validation tests
- Strategy execution performance benchmarks
- Pattern recognition accuracy tests
- Multi-symbol strategy coordination tests
- Real-time processing latency tests
- Strategy optimization algorithm tests

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use TypeScript for all strategy engine components
2. Implement a formal grammar parser using tools like ANTLR or PEG.js
3. Create a comprehensive indicator library with proper mathematical validation
4. Use WebAssembly for performance-critical calculation components
5. Implement comprehensive logging for strategy decision tracing
6. Create a strategy sandbox environment for safe testing
7. Use event-driven architecture for real-time signal processing
8. Implement proper error boundaries for strategy execution
9. Create detailed documentation with strategy examples
10. Use Redis for strategy state caching and coordination
```

## Notes

- DSL should be intuitive for traders without programming experience
- All indicators must be mathematically accurate and validated
- Strategy execution must handle market data gaps gracefully
- Consider implementing genetic algorithms for parameter optimization
- Pattern recognition requires significant historical data for training
