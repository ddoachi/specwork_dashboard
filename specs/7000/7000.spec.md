# User Interface & Dashboard

## Overview

Develop a comprehensive user interface system including a Progressive Web App (PWA) dashboard and mobile applications that provide real-time monitoring, strategy management, and control over the automated trading system. This epic includes advanced charting, real-time data visualization, strategy builder interface, and mobile-first responsive design.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Progressive Web App with offline capabilities and service worker
- [ ] Real-time dashboard with live P&L, positions, and market data
- [ ] Interactive charting with technical indicators and entry/exit markers
- [ ] Visual strategy builder with drag-and-drop DSL composition
- [ ] Multi-broker account management interface
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design optimized for phones and tablets
- [ ] Real-time notifications and alert management
- [ ] Portfolio performance analytics and reporting
- [ ] Risk management controls and emergency stop interface
- [ ] Dark/light theme with customizable layouts

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
2. Implement WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection
3. Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
4. Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
5. Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
6. Create a comprehensive design system with reusable components
7. Implement proper SEO and performance optimization
8. Use Chart.js or TradingView Charting Library for advanced charts
9. Implement proper authentication with JWT tokens
10. Create comprehensive E2E tests using Playwright or Cypress
```

## Notes

- Focus on mobile-first responsive design for broad accessibility
- Real-time updates must be efficient to avoid performance issues
- Consider implementing WebGL for high-performance charting
- UI should be intuitive for both technical and non-technical users
- Offline capabilities are important for mobile trading scenarios
