# Simple Deployment

## Metadata
```yaml
id: E05
type: epic

## Description
The Simple Deployment epic provides a straightforward deployment solution with basic authentication using .htpasswd and Docker containers. This enables secure external access to the dashboard without complex authentication systems, focusing on simplicity and ease of deployment.

## Scope
- [ ] Docker configuration for frontend and backend services
- [ ] Basic authentication using .htpasswd file
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy configuration with auth
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for single-command deployment
- [ ] Environment configuration for external network access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single docker-compose up command deploys entire system
- [ ] .htpasswd authentication protects dashboard access
- [ ] Dashboard accessible from external network via configured port
- [ ] JTS specs mounted as read-only volume in container
- [ ] Configuration supports both development and production modes

## Dependencies
- E01 (Dashboard Core) - Requires dashboard application
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Needs data sync services

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: Docker Container Configuration
- F02: Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup
- F03: Basic Auth Implementation
- F04: Docker Compose Orchestration
- F05: Environment Configuration

## Technical Considerations
- Use multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Configure Nginx for both auth and reverse proxy
- Use Docker secrets for .htpasswd file
- Implement health checks for container monitoring
- Configure proper CORS headers for API access
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Priority on simplicity over complex authentication
- Focus on easy deployment and maintenance
