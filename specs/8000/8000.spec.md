# Monitoring & Observability

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive monitoring and observability system that provides real-time visibility into system health, performance metrics, trading operations, and business KPIs. This epic includes system health dashboards, distributed tracing, structured logging, alerting mechanisms, audit trails, and compliance reporting to ensure the trading system operates reliably and meets regulatory requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time system health monitoring dashboards with <5-second update intervals
- [ ] Comprehensive performance metrics collection and visualization
- [ ] Distributed tracing with correlation IDs across all microservices
- [ ] Structured logging with centralized aggregation and search capabilities
- [ ] Multi-channel alert system with WebSocket push notifications
- [ ] API rate limit tracking and broker quota monitoring
- [ ] Trading-specific metrics (fill rates, slippage, P&L attribution)
- [ ] Error rate monitoring with automatic anomaly detection
- [ ] Audit logging and compliance tracking for regulatory requirements
- [ ] Custom dashboards for different user roles (traders, risk managers, operators)
- [ ] Performance SLA monitoring with automated reporting
- [ ] Infrastructure cost tracking and optimization insights

## Technical Approach

### Monitoring Architecture
Design a multi-layered observability stack that captures metrics, logs, and traces from all system components, providing both technical and business insights through unified dashboards and intelligent alerting.

### Key Components

1. **Metrics Collection & Storage**
   - Application performance metrics
   - Business KPIs (trading volume, P&L, order success rates)
   - Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk)
   - Custom trading metrics (latency, slippage, correlation)
   - Time-series database for efficient storage and querying

2. **Distributed Tracing System**
   - Request correlation across microservices
   - Trading flow tracing (order placement to execution)
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Error propagation tracking
   - Market data flow visibility

3. **Centralized Logging Platform**
   - Structured JSON logging with consistent schema
   - Log aggregation from all services
   - Real-time log streaming and search
   - Log retention and archival policies
   - Security event logging

4. **Real-time Dashboard System**
   - System health overview dashboard
   - Trading performance dashboard
   - Risk management dashboard
   - Infrastructure monitoring dashboard
   - Custom user-defined dashboards

5. **Intelligent Alerting Framework**
   - Multi-threshold alerting (warning, critical, emergency)
   - WebSocket push notifications to UI
   - Slack/Teams integration
   - Email and SMS notifications
   - Alert escalation and acknowledgment

6. **Audit & Compliance Tracking**
   - All trading decisions and executions
   - User access and actions
   - Configuration changes
   - Data access patterns
   - Regulatory compliance reporting

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design Observability Schema**
   - Define metrics taxonomy
   - Create logging standards
   - Design tracing correlation strategy
   - Plan dashboard layouts

2. **Implement Metrics Collection**
   - Set up Prometheus/InfluxDB for metrics storage
   - Create custom metrics for trading operations
   - Implement performance counters
   - Add business metric tracking

3. **Build Tracing Infrastructure**
   - Implement OpenTelemetry integration
   - Add correlation ID propagation
   - Create trace visualization
   - Set up sampling strategies

4. **Create Logging Platform**
   - Set up ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Implement structured logging libraries
   - Create log shipping and aggregation
   - Set up log retention policies

5. **Develop Dashboard System**
   - Build real-time dashboard backend
   - Create responsive dashboard UI
   - Implement custom chart components
   - Add dashboard sharing capabilities

6. **Implement Alerting System**
   - Create alert rule engine
   - Build notification delivery system
   - Implement alert management UI
   - Add escalation workflows

7. **Build Audit System**
   - Create audit event schema
   - Implement audit trail collection
   - Build compliance reporting
   - Add audit log search interface

## Dependencies

- **1000**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires Redis for real-time metrics caching and basic infrastructure

## Testing Plan

- Metrics collection accuracy validation
- Dashboard load testing and performance verification
- Alert system reliability and latency tests
- Trace correlation accuracy across services
- Log aggregation and search performance tests
- Audit trail completeness verification
- Dashboard responsiveness under load tests
- Alert delivery mechanism reliability tests

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics visualization
2. Implement OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
3. Set up ELK stack for centralized logging
4. Use WebSocket connections for real-time dashboard updates
5. Store audit logs in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
6. Implement correlation IDs using UUIDs
7. Create health check endpoints for all services
8. Use structured logging (JSON format) consistently
9. Implement graceful degradation when monitoring systems fail
10. Set up automated dashboard provisioning
11. Create comprehensive alerting runbooks
12. Use environment variables for all monitoring configuration
```

## Monitoring Specifications

### System Health Metrics
- Service uptime and availability
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Error rates and exception tracking
- Database connection pool status
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Network latency between services

### Trading Performance Metrics
- Order execution latency (market data to order placement)
- Fill rate percentage by symbol and strategy
- Slippage tracking and analysis
- Trading volume and frequency
- P&L attribution by strategy and symbol
