## Description
Implement comprehensive responsive design patterns across all dashboard components to ensure optimal user experience on devices ranging from mobile phones to ultra-wide monitors. This feature establishes responsive breakpoints, adaptive layouts, and touch-friendly interactions while maintaining functionality and visual hierarchy across all screen sizes.

## Scope
- [ ] Define responsive breakpoint system (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
- [ ] Implement adaptive grid layouts for different screen sizes
- [ ] Create mobile-optimized navigation patterns
- [ ] Design touch-friendly interaction zones
- [ ] Optimize typography scaling across devices
- [ ] Implement responsive data tables and charts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard functions correctly on screens from 320px to 3840px width
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum 44x44px requirement on mobile
- [ ] Text remains readable without horizontal scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Complex visualizations adapt gracefully to smaller screens
- [ ] Performance metrics (FCP, LCP) remain under 2s on mobile
- [ ] All interactive elements are accessible via touch, mouse, and keyboard

## Dependencies
- E01-F01 (Dashboard Layout) - Requires base layout
- E01-F02 (Statistics Panel) - Needs responsive cards
- E01-F03 (Progress Visualization) - Requires adaptive charts
- E01-F04 (Specification Tree) - Needs mobile tree view

## Tasks
To be defined when feature is broken down:
- T01: Setup responsive breakpoint system
- T02: Implement mobile navigation pattern
- T03: Create responsive grid components
- T04: Optimize touch interactions
- T05: Build responsive data tables
- T06: Adapt visualizations for mobile

## Technical Considerations
- Use CSS Container Queries where appropriate
- Implement progressive enhancement strategy
- Consider using viewport units carefully
- Test on actual devices, not just browser DevTools
- Optimize bundle size for mobile networks

## Notes
- Critical for accessibility and reach
- Consider offline-first approach for mobile
- Test with various device orientations
