## Description
Design and implement the core dashboard layout structure with navigation components. This feature establishes the foundational UI framework including the main layout grid, navigation header, sidebar components, and content areas. It provides the structural scaffold upon which all other dashboard components will be integrated.

## Scope
- [ ] Main application shell with header, sidebar, and content areas
- [ ] Navigation header with branding and primary actions
- [ ] Collapsible sidebar for secondary navigation
- [ ] Responsive grid system for content layout
- [ ] Theme provider setup for consistent styling
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton screens

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard layout renders correctly on desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (375x667)
- [ ] Sidebar can collapse/expand with smooth animation
- [ ] Navigation maintains state across page refreshes
- [ ] Layout components are accessible with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Loading skeleton displays during data fetching
- [ ] Theme variables are properly applied throughout the layout

## Dependencies
- Next.js 14 App Router setup
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- shadcn/ui component library

## Tasks

- T01: Setup base Next.js layout structure
- T02: Implement header navigation component
- T03: Create collapsible sidebar
- T04: Design responsive grid system
- T05: Add loading states and skeletons

## Technical Considerations

## Notes
