## Description
Implement a comprehensive statistics panel that provides real-time insights into project specification status. This feature displays aggregated metrics including total counts, status distributions, and completion rates for epics, features, and tasks. The panel serves as the primary dashboard component for quick project health assessment.

## Scope
- [ ] Summary cards showing total counts for epics, features, and tasks
- [ ] Status distribution breakdown (pending, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- [ ] Completion percentage calculations
- [ ] Priority distribution visualization
- [ ] Effort estimation summaries
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Statistics update within 100ms of data changes
- [ ] All metrics calculate correctly based on spec metadata
- [ ] Cards display loading states during data fetching
- [ ] Numbers format properly with appropriate separators
- [ ] Color coding matches status conventions (green/yellow/red/gray)
- [ ] Panel is responsive and readable on all screen sizes

## Dependencies
- E01-F01 (Dashboard Layout) - Requires layout framework
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Needs synchronized spec data

## Tasks
To be defined when feature is broken down:
- T01: Create summary card component
- T02: Implement metrics calculation logic
- T03: Add status distribution charts
- T04: Design priority breakdown display
- T05: Build effort aggregation system
- T06: Setup auto-refresh mechanism

## Technical Considerations
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Consider using recharts for data visualization
- Cache calculated metrics to improve performance
- Use TypeScript for type-safe calculations

## Notes
- Critical for project overview at a glance
- Must handle large datasets efficiently
- Consider adding export functionality in future
