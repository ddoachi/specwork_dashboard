## Description
Develop an interactive hierarchical tree view component that displays the complete specification structure from epics down to tasks. This feature enables intuitive navigation through the project's specification hierarchy with expand/collapse functionality, search capabilities, and visual status indicators at each level.

## Scope
- [ ] Hierarchical tree rendering (Epic → Feature → Task → Subtask)
- [ ] Expand/collapse functionality with state persistence
- [ ] Visual status indicators at each node
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities within the tree
- [ ] Drag-and-drop for reorganization (future consideration)
- [ ] Context menu for quick actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tree renders complete specification hierarchy accurately
- [ ] Expand/collapse states persist across page refreshes
- [ ] Search highlights matching nodes within 100ms
- [ ] Tree handles 1000+ nodes without performance degradation
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (arrow keys, enter, space)
- [ ] Visual indicators clearly show node status and type

## Dependencies
- E01-F01 (Dashboard Layout) - Requires layout integration
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Needs hierarchical spec data

## Tasks
To be defined when feature is broken down:
- T01: Create tree node component
- T02: Implement recursive tree rendering
- T03: Add expand/collapse logic
- T04: Build search functionality
- T05: Design status indicators
- T06: Add keyboard navigation
- T07: Implement state persistence

## Technical Considerations
- Use virtualization for large trees (react-window)
- Implement lazy loading for deep hierarchies
- Consider using react-arborist or similar library
- Optimize re-renders with careful memoization
- Use IndexedDB for state persistence

## Notes
- Core navigation component for spec exploration
- Must scale to handle large projects
- Consider accessibility requirements for tree navigation
