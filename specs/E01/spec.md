## Metadata

## Description
The Dashboard Core epic encompasses the main visualization interface for the JTS Spec Dashboard. This includes the primary dashboard layout with real-time statistics, progress tracking, and hierarchical specification tree view. The dashboard provides immediate visibility into project status without requiring navigation through the file system.

## Scope
- [ ] Quick stats panel showing totals for epics, features, and tasks with status counts
- [ ] Interactive progress bars per epic showing completion percentages
- [ ] Hierarchical tree view with expandable Epic → Feature → Task structure
- [ ] Responsive dashboard layout with mobile-first design
- [ ] Real-time updates when spec data changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds showing current project statistics
- [ ] Progress bars accurately reflect completion status from spec metadata
- [ ] Tree view allows navigation through entire specification hierarchy
- [ ] Dashboard is fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- [ ] Status indicators use consistent color coding (green=completed, yellow=in-progress, red=blocked)

## Dependencies
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Requires synchronized spec data to display
- E05 (Simple Deployment) - Needs deployment infrastructure for access

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: Dashboard Layout and Navigation
- F02: Statistics and Metrics Panel
- F03: Progress Visualization
- F04: Specification Tree Component
- F05: Responsive Design Implementation

## Technical Considerations
- Use Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance
- Implement TanStack Query for efficient data fetching
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Consider virtual scrolling for large specification sets
- Implement WebSocket or polling for real-time updates

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Focus on core visualization without complex authentication
- Prioritize performance and user experience
