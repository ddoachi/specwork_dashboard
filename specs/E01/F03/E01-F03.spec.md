## Description
Create interactive progress visualization components that display completion status across different hierarchy levels. This feature provides visual feedback on project advancement through progress bars, charts, and indicators that help stakeholders quickly understand project health and identify bottlenecks.

## Scope
- [ ] Epic-level progress bars showing feature completion
- [ ] Feature-level progress indicators with task breakdown
- [ ] Overall project completion percentage
- [ ] Burndown/burnup chart components
- [ ] Status timeline visualization
- [ ] Interactive tooltips with detailed metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress bars accurately reflect completion percentages
- [ ] Visual updates occur smoothly with animations
- [ ] Hover states reveal detailed breakdown information
- [ ] Charts are interactive and allow drilling down
- [ ] Color gradients indicate progress health (0-30% red, 31-70% yellow, 71-100% green)
- [ ] All visualizations are accessible with screen readers

## Dependencies
- E01-F02 (Statistics Panel) - Uses calculated metrics
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Requires real-time data

## Tasks
To be defined when feature is broken down:
- T01: Build progress bar component
- T02: Implement percentage calculation logic
- T03: Create burndown chart visualization
- T04: Add interactive tooltips
- T05: Design status timeline view
- T06: Implement drill-down functionality

## Technical Considerations
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implement virtual rendering for large datasets
- Consider D3.js for complex visualizations
- Ensure colorblind-friendly palettes
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo

## Notes
- Key visual feedback mechanism for stakeholders
- Must be performant with hundreds of specs
- Consider adding customizable view options
