## Description
The Search and Filtering epic enables users to quickly find and filter specifications across the entire JTS project. This includes full-text search capabilities, advanced filtering by status and type, and quick navigation to search results within the dashboard interface.

## Scope
- [ ] Full-text search across all specification content
- [ ] Filter by specification type (epic, feature, task)
- [ ] Filter by status (draft, planning, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- [ ] Search results highlighting with context snippets
- [ ] Quick jump navigation from search results

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search queries return results in under 500ms
- [ ] Search finds matches in both spec.md and context.md files
- [ ] Filters can be combined for refined results
- [ ] Search results show relevant context around matches
- [ ] Clicking search result navigates to specification

## Dependencies
- E02 (Data Synchronization) - Requires indexed spec content
- E01 (Dashboard Core) - Integrates with dashboard UI

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: Search Index Implementation
- F02: Query Parser and Executor
- F03: Filter Components
- F04: Search Results Display
- F05: Search Performance Optimization

## Technical Considerations
- Consider using lunr.js or flexsearch for client-side search
- Implement debouncing for search-as-you-type
- Use database full-text search for server-side queries
- Cache frequently searched terms
- Implement search result pagination

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Balance between search performance and accuracy
- Consider implementing search suggestions
