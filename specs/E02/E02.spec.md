```

## Description
The Data Synchronization System provides the critical bridge between the JTS project's specification data and the dashboard. This epic implements a consumer-focused architecture that fetches processed spec data from JTS APIs, maintaining real-time synchronization without direct file system access. The dashboard acts as a pure data consumer, displaying visualization and insights from the JTS-provided spec data.

## Scope
- [ ] API client service for fetching spec data from JTS endpoints
- [ ] WebSocket/SSE client for real-time spec updates
- [ ] Local database schema for caching API responses
- [ ] Data synchronization service for API-to-database sync
- [ ] Fallback mechanism for API unavailability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard receives spec updates within 5 seconds of JTS changes
- [ ] API client handles all error scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Local cache maintains 100% accuracy with JTS API data
- [ ] Initial data load completes in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Zero direct access to JTS filesystem (API-only communication)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational epic)

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: API Client Service (REST/GraphQL client for JTS API)
- F02: Real-time Updates Handler (WebSocket/SSE integration)
- F03: Local Cache Database (Schema and ORM for caching)
- F04: Data Synchronization Engine (API-to-cache sync logic)
- F05: Resilience and Fallback Mechanisms

## Technical Considerations
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Docker volume mount for quick prototype (read-only)
- **Phase 2 (Target)**: Full API-based architecture
- Use axios/fetch for API client with retry logic
- Implement Socket.io or SSE for real-time updates
- Use SQLite for local cache, with potential PostgreSQL upgrade
- Design circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Cache invalidation strategy for stale data
- Consider GraphQL for efficient data fetching

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Critical infrastructure component - must be robust and reliable
- Performance is key for real-time updates
