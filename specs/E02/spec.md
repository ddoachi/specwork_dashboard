# Data Synchronization System

## Metadata
```yaml
id: E02
type: epic

priority: critical

## Description
The Data Synchronization System provides the critical bridge between the JTS project's specification files and the dashboard database. This epic implements read-only filesystem monitoring, spec file parsing, and database synchronization to ensure the dashboard always displays current project status without modifying source files.

## Scope
- [ ] Filesystem watcher service for monitoring JTS spec file changes
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parser for extracting spec metadata
- [ ] Database schema design for storing spec hierarchy and metadata
- [ ] Batch synchronization service for initial data load
- [ ] Incremental sync for real-time updates on file changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System detects JTS spec file changes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Parser correctly extracts all metadata from spec.md and context.md files
- [ ] Database maintains 100% accuracy with source spec files
- [ ] Synchronization completes in under 30 seconds for full project scan
- [ ] Zero modifications to JTS project files (read-only guarantee)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational epic)

## Features
To be defined when epic is split into features:
- F01: Filesystem Monitoring Service
- F02: Spec File Parser
- F03: Database Schema and ORM
- F04: Synchronization Engine
- F05: Change Detection and Incremental Updates

## Technical Considerations
- Use chokidar for cross-platform file watching
- Implement gray-matter for YAML frontmatter parsing
- Use SQLite for development, easy migration to PostgreSQL
- Design idempotent sync operations for reliability
- Implement proper error handling for malformed spec files
- Mount JTS specs directory as read-only Docker volume

## Notes
- Generated from PRD document
- Critical infrastructure component - must be robust and reliable
- Performance is key for real-time updates
