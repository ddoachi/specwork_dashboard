## Routing Specifications

### Routing Factors
```typescript
interface RoutingFactors {
  executionQuality: number;    // Historical fill quality (0-100)
  latency: number;            // Average execution latency (ms)
  fees: number;               // Transaction costs
  liquidity: number;          // Available liquidity score
  availability: number;       // Broker uptime percentage
  rateLimit: number;          // Available rate limit capacity
  marketImpact: number;       // Estimated price impact
}
```

### Routing Strategies
```typescript
enum RoutingStrategy {
  BEST_EXECUTION = 'best_execution',     // Optimize for price
  FASTEST = 'fastest',                    // Minimize latency
  CHEAPEST = 'cheapest',                  // Minimize fees
  LIQUIDITY_SEEKING = 'liquidity',        // Maximum liquidity
  BALANCED = 'balanced',                  // Weighted combination
  CUSTOM = 'custom'                       // User-defined rules
}
```

### Order Classifications
```typescript
enum OrderSize {
  SMALL = 'small',      // <$10,000
  MEDIUM = 'medium',    // $10,000-$100,000
  LARGE = 'large',      // $100,000-$1,000,000
  BLOCK = 'block'       // >$1,000,000
}

enum OrderUrgency {
  IMMEDIATE = 'immediate',  // Fill ASAP
  NORMAL = 'normal',        // Standard priority
  PATIENT = 'patient'       // Can wait for better price
}
```

## Routing Rules Examples

### Rule: Large Order Splitting

  splitIntoChildOrders(order, {
    strategy: 'TWAP',
    duration: '5m',
    maxChildSize: 10000
  });
}
```

### Rule: Broker Selection
```typescript
selectBroker({
  weights: {
    executionQuality: 0.4,
    fees: 0.2,
    latency: 0.2,
    liquidity: 0.2
  },
  constraints: {
    minQuality: 80,
    maxLatency: 100,
    requiresAvailable: true
  }
});
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Routing decision distribution
- Execution quality by broker
- Average slippage
- Fill rates
- Routing latency
- Cost savings

### Dashboards
- Real-time routing flow
- Broker performance comparison
- Execution quality trends
- Cost analysis

## Notes

- Consider regulatory requirements for best execution
- Different markets may have different optimal routes
- Time of day significantly affects execution quality
- Large orders require special handling to minimize impact
- ML models need continuous retraining with new data
- Consider implementing smart order types (iceberg, TWAP, VWAP)
- Fallback to simple routing if smart routing fails
