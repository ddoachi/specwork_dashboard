- [ ] Execution quality metrics (slippage, fill rates)
- [ ] Compliance monitoring for regulatory requirements
- [ ] Alerting system for critical issues configured
- [ ] Operational dashboards created in Grafana
- [ ] Distributed tracing implemented
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis setup
- [ ] Anomaly detection algorithms deployed
- [ ] SLA tracking and reporting
- [ ] Audit trail completeness verified
- [ ] 5+ year data retention configured
- [ ] Automated compliance reports generation
