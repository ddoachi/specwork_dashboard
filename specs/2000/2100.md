# Unified Broker Interface Foundation

## Overview

Create the core abstraction layer with standardized interfaces, data models, and error handling patterns for broker-agnostic operations. This foundational feature establishes the contract that all broker implementations must follow, ensuring consistency across different broker integrations while maintaining flexibility for broker-specific optimizations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IBroker TypeScript interface defined with all required methods
- [ ] Common DTOs created for Order, Position, Balance, Transaction, Market Data
- [ ] Standardized error code system with broker-specific mapping
- [ ] Response transformation layer implemented
- [ ] Broker factory pattern for instantiation
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with 95% coverage
- [ ] TypeDoc documentation for all interfaces and models
- [ ] Order lifecycle management supporting all states (pending, partial, filled, cancelled)
- [ ] Support for all Korean market order types (market, limit, conditional, etc.)
- [ ] Data normalization for price precision, lot sizes, and currency formats

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture

Implement a broker abstraction layer using TypeScript interfaces and the Adapter pattern. Each broker will implement the IBroker interface while maintaining its unique characteristics through broker-specific adapters.

### Key Components

1. **IBroker Interface**
   - Market data methods (quotes, orderbook, ticks)
   - Trading methods (place, modify, cancel orders)
   - Account methods (balance, positions, history)
   - Connection management (connect, disconnect, health)
   - Configuration methods

2. **Common Data Models**
   ```typescript
   - Order: Unified order representation
   - Position: Current position details
   - Balance: Account balance information
   - MarketData: Price quotes and ticks
   - Transaction: Trade execution details
   - OrderBook: Bid/ask depth data
   - AccountInfo: Account metadata
   ```

3. **Error Handling System**
   - BrokerError base class
   - Error code enumeration
   - Error mapping registry
   - Retry policy configuration

4. **Response Transformation**
   - Normalization pipelines
   - Data validation
   - Type conversion
   - Currency handling

5. **Broker Factory**
   - Dynamic broker instantiation
   - Configuration management
   - Dependency injection support

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Core Interfaces**
   - Create IBroker interface with comprehensive method signatures
   - Define IBrokerConfig for broker-specific configuration
   - Establish IMarketDataProvider and ITradingProvider sub-interfaces
   - Add lifecycle hooks for initialization and cleanup

2. **Create Data Models**
   - Design normalized DTOs with validation decorators
   - Implement serialization/deserialization logic
   - Add model conversion utilities
   - Define enumerations for order types, statuses, etc.

3. **Build Error System**
   - Implement hierarchical error classes
   - Create error mapping registry
   - Add context preservation for debugging
   - Define retry strategies

4. **Implement Transformation Layer**
   - Create data normalization pipelines
   - Add validation middleware
   - Implement type coercion
   - Build response caching layer

5. **Develop Factory Pattern**
   - Create BrokerFactory class
   - Implement broker registration system
   - Add configuration validation
   - Support dependency injection

## Trading-Specific Requirements

### Order Lifecycle Management
- Support all order states: pending, submitted, partial fill, filled, cancelled, rejected
- Handle order amendments and cancellations
- Track execution history with timestamps
- Maintain order-to-trade relationships

### Market Data Normalization
- Standardize price formats (decimal places, tick sizes)
- Normalize volume representations
- Convert timestamps to UTC
- Handle currency conversions

### Performance Specifications
- Order placement latency: <50ms
- Balance/position queries: <100ms
- Connection initialization: <5 seconds
- Memory footprint: <10MB per broker instance

## Dependencies

- **1000**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires TypeScript configuration, monorepo structure

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for all interfaces and models
- Integration tests with mock broker implementations
- Performance benchmarks for transformation layer
- Memory leak detection tests
- Concurrent operation stress tests
- Data validation edge case testing

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this feature:
1. Start by creating the IBroker interface in libs/shared/interfaces/broker.interface.ts
2. Use class-validator for DTO validation
3. Implement the Adapter pattern for broker-specific implementations
4. Use discriminated unions for type-safe error handling
5. Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
6. Create factory methods for common scenarios
7. Use dependency injection tokens for NestJS integration
8. Implement proper TypeScript generics for flexibility
9. Add runtime type checking for external data
10. Create builder patterns for complex objects
```

## Notes

- This is the foundation that all other broker features depend on
- Changes to interfaces will impact all broker implementations
- Consider backward compatibility when modifying interfaces
- Performance is critical - avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Korean market specifics must be accommodated in the design

## Status Updates

- **2025-08-25**: Feature spec created and documented
